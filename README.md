# PathFinding
Program uses a genetic algorithm, with DNA encoded as vectors to find path to target

Each member of the population has DNA that is encoded as a series of vectors that tells the member where to move. After each generation, the best members are chosen to reproduce.
Obstacles can be added to increase the difficulty for members.
